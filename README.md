Feedr by Tim is a news feed app that pulls news articles from three APIs:

1. News API
2. New York Times Search API
3. GNews API

User experience:

When Feedr is first visited the app displays a home feed of news articles pulled from all three API sources ordered by date of publication. If the user wishes to see articles from a single source the user can do so by selecting a source from the dropdown menu. The user can also click the search icon to open a search bar and filter articles in the present feed. Articles are filtered after each character is entered. If the user presses the enter/return key, a keyword search is performed, returning articles from News API. To get back to the main feed, the user can click the "Feedr" logo in the left corner of the header bar.
